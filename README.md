## Description


This Python code analyzes a dataset of movies and tests two hypotheses: <br /> 
1) The correlation between budget and gross earnings <br /> 
2) The correlation between gross earnings and votes <br /> 
The most significant finding of the analysis is that the gross earnings of movies are highly correlated with the budget and votes (0.74 , 0.61).
These results can be useful for filmmakers, studios, and investors looking to make informed decisions about the production and marketing of movies. 
By investing in higher-budget films and promoting them to a wider audience, filmmakers and studios can increase their chances of achieving box office success.
